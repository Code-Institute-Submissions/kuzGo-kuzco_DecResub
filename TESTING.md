# Testing :
<a name="totop"/>


At various stages of the project development I have been using extensive testing of the website.Main tools used to test the website are Google Dev Tools,Firefox Dev Tools . To validate the code  I have been using W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator - PEP8 Online to ensure proper indentation and full PEP8 compliance. During development The [Built-In Django's Debugger](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/) was set to `True` so the code has been refactored on multiple occasions should any errors occurred.

- Issue : One of the major issues occured after deploying my project, static files no longer work on localhost.
- Steps I took to resolve: I tried setting DEBUG=True, DEVELOPMNET= True, commented out postgres DB and and added : `STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')`, ran ``collectstatic`` , however, css and JS are not working locally. 
  * Posted the issue on Slack channel #project-milestone-4 for assistance.
  * Contacted the Code Istitute Tutor support (Tutor Jo)
- Solution : Uncomment the database, revert everything back to the original code and checked for typos in `DEVELOPMNET= True`

- Issue : During developing `update_reviews` in my ``Reviews`` class I have been constantly receiving an ``error 404``.
- Steps I took to resolve: Refactoring the code and tried to chnage the `{% url %}` hovewer, after contacting Tutor support, with the assistance of Tutor Igor, we 
finally solved the issue.
- Solution : Moving the `{% url %}` to the `reviews.html` and unindent the `return` code to render properly.

- Issue: During long hours of coding I ran into a bug while developing `checkout` models. 
- Steps I took to resolve: Refactoring the code. posted the issue #project-milestone-4 for assistance. Contacted the Code Istitute Tutor support (Tutor Sean)
- Solution:Sean spotted typo in `OrderLineItem` class and also the issue that I accidentally entered the code there insted in `Order` class. After refactoring the code the issue has been resolved.

#### Known Issues:

My main focus while working on this project was developing functionalities, this had an effect on the website's UI. Due to the close deadline I had to 
compromise some features. 

- Site footer currently has `position:relative` this makes it jump to the middle of the page if the page lacks the content, such as empty shopping cart.
- Shopping cart content is pushing the whole page to the left, this is to be further developed.
- Landing page lacks content, this is to be further developed.
