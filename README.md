Kuzco Watches is a final project with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/).
Project purpose:
In this project, I built a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. An authentication mechanism has been set and provides paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product.

- Testing file can be found here [TESTING.md](https://github.com/kuzGo/kuzco/blob/main/TESTING.md) 




## Deployment
<a name="deployment"/>

### Version control 

- The project's website code was written using Gitpod IDE. In order for code to be pushed to GitHub,it had to be added to stage for commit using `git add `command in GitPod's CLI .Once changes have been successfully added, it is required to commit these entering `git commit -m` into CLI. After committing it then can be pushed to GitHub by entering `git push` command in CLI.

### GitHub

- How to fork a repository: Forking a repository allows you to make changes to the code without affecting the project. To fork a repository follow the next steps:
1. If you do not have one,create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and remain logged in.
2. Navigate to [kuzGo/kuzco](https://github.com/kuzGo/kuzco);
3. In the top right corner find the "Fork" icon.
4. Click the Fork icon to fork the repository.

- How to clone repository: Cloning repository allows you to pull down a full copy of the repository and work on it locally on your machine. To clone a repository follow these steps:
1. If you do not have one,create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and remain logged in.
2. Navigate to [kuzGo/kuzco](https://github.com/kuzGo/kuzco);
3. On the repository main page navigate to the "Code" drop down menu button and click on it.
4. Ensure to select HTTPS and click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
5. In the IDE you chose to work, open the new terminal.
6. Change the current working directory location where you want the cloned directory.
7. Enter command git clone and paste the URL you copied.
8. Click Enter.



### Heroku

- The website is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) due to GitHub's ability to only host static pages. To successfully  deploy the website to Heroku please follow these steps.

### Prerequisite
In order to successfully  run the app on Heroku,there are a few applications and dependencies required.
1. In the IDE terminal enter command `pip3 freeze--local > requirements.txt`.
2. Create Procfile using CLI command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Delete a blank line to avoid any possible issues with the app.
- Heroku Deployment

1. If you do not have one,create a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account and remain logged in.
2. For this particular project Python needs to be selected as a Primary Development Language.
3. Navigate to "Create New App" button.
4. Create a unique app name using hyphens instead of spaces.
5. Choose a region closest to you. I selected my region Europe.
6. Click Create App button.
7. In the Deploy section, as Deployment method select GitHub,this option will automatically deploy from GutHub repository.
8. In the Connect to GitHub section ensure that your GitHub profile is displayed.
9. Enter repository name and click Search button.
10. Once repository is found click Connect button.
11. Navigate to settings and click Reveal Config Vars.
12. Enter variables from `env.py` file :AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,STRIPE_WH_SECRET, SECRET_KEY. This is required step since Heroku will not be able to find these secured in `gitignore` folder.

<p><img src="Docs/confvars.PNG" style="min-width:30%" height="100" alt="Heroku App snip"></p>

13. Prior to enabling automatic deployment, make sure that requirements.txt and Procfile are pushed (`git push`)to GitHub.
14. Click Deploy Branch button.

### Code snippets :

For the purpose of this project I refered to and used authentication from the Code Institute Chris's [Boutique ADO](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1).
The code snnipets used from this project have been refactored to make them my own and suit more my project's needs where it was possible.

[**Bootsrap4**](https://getbootstrap.com/) some components and some code snnipets have been used from Bootsrap.
