In order for code to be pushed to GitHub,it had to be added to stage for commit using `git add `command in GitPod's CLI .Once changes have been successfully added, it is required to commit these entering `git commit -m` into CLI. After committing it then can be pushed to GitHub by entering `git push` command in CLI.

1. In the IDE terminal enter command `pip3 freeze--local > requirements.txt`.
2. Create Procfile using CLI command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Delete a blank line to avoid any possible issues with the app.
- Heroku Deployment

2. For this particular project Python needs to be selected as a Primary Development Language.
3. Navigate to "Create New App" button.
4. Create a unique app name using hyphens instead of spaces.
5. Choose a region closest to you. I selected my region Europe.
6. Click Create App button.
7. In the Deploy section, as Deployment method select GitHub,this option will automatically deploy from GutHub repository.
